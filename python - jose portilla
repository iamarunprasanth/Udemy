DataTypes:
1. Numbers are mutable, 
2. Strings are immutable, each letter in a string is considered as sequence of characters
   strings can be quoted with single and double quotes.
   indexing and slicing is possible over strings
3. List - are sequence of characters of multiple datatypes also it is mutable. Each character of the list can be mutable.
          indexing and slicing is possible since it represents sequence of characters 
4. Dictionary - Key and value pair, can store any kind of datatype. It is an unordered collection, as it represents key and value pair.
5. Tuple - they are like lists, but it is immutable, can be used when the data shouldn't be changed.
