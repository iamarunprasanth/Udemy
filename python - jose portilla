Numbers are mutable, 
Strings are immutable, each letter in a string is considered as sequence so through index so:
String ="arun"
String[0] =a
we can do indexing and slicing on a string. String[1:4:2:] 1st denotes starts from exclusive 2nd denotes end string inclusive last 
denotes occurences will get ignored.
