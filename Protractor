Protractor is used for testing angular JS application and non angular js application as well.
works as a Solution integrator combining powerful technologies like Selenium, Jasmine, Web driver, etc.

Protractor is a NodeJS program which is written in JavaScript and runs with Node to identinfy the web elements in AngularJS applications, 
and it also uses WebDriver to control the browser with user actions.

AngularJS applications are Web Applications which uses extended HTML's syntax to express web application components. 
It is mainly used for dynamic web applications. These applications use less and flexible code compared with normal Web Applications.

Angular JS applications have some extra HTML attributes like ng-repeater, ng-controller, ng-model.., etc. 
which are not included in Selenium locators

The protractor is an end to end testing framework for Angular JS based applications. While most frameworks focus on conducting unit tests for Angular JS applications, 
Protractor focuses on testing the actual functionality of an application.
1. install selenium
2. install node.js
3. in cmd, npm install -g protractor 
to check version protractor -version
4. webdriver-manager update
5. webdriver-manager start

Sample AngularJS application testing using Protractor
Protractor needs 2 files to run, a spec file and configuration file.

Configuration file: This File helps protractor to where the test files are placed (specs.js) and to talk with Selenium server (Selenium Address). Chrome is the default browser for Protractor.
Spec file: This File contains the logic and locators to interact with the application.
